    <h1>Short Story</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      All was dark and silent in the deep, cold dark of space. The evernothings came upon us, enveloping us in the evergloom. We were but children among the stars, our feeble minds unable to comprehend the sheer realities of space and time in all their cosmic wonder. The evernothings were from beyond...beyond our reckoning, and we could not exist where they existed. They brought the evergloom, that crippling darkness, that ever-present void, that inundating vacuum.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sought to kindle hope among the stars, to find among those wandering planets a new home for our kind. Our own world was barren, tired and abused from millenia of our vainglorious exploitations. We would treat this new world we found with reverence and respect even as we mourned the folly of our forebears.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, it seemed, exile from our beloved and dying Earth was not punishment enough for the sins of our fathers. For the evernothings sought us out. They tracked us silently, malevolently and maliciously across the endless voids of space. They declared that the evergloom was our destiny. We, humans, who had devoured all things in our path to transcendence would in turn be consumed by the evergloom. For only in this end would the justice of the cosmos be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made our stand against the evergloom at the threshold of our new home. Our starships were derelict and exhausted from the journey. We gathered together in those ancient vessels and recited to one another all the greatest works of art our species had made in its short time in the universe. Perhaps amongst all that creation we might find our deliverance, we might prove ourselves worthy of existence and thus dissuade the evernothings from their quest for our annihilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what had we to show for ourselves? Should we play our greatests symphonies, recite our most epic literature, project our most masterful paintings? It was the young child Gwen who at last suggested our greatest work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All these things are wondrous and beautiful, but none can compare to our most precious creation," she stated boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our greatest work of art is the love that we give to one another, the sacrifices we make for each other, the willingness to surrender our own desires for the sake of another. This is our greatest work."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we presented to the evernothings and the evergloom all the depths of our love for one another. And in that one act, we banished the darkness from our midst and found our new hope. For no force in this universe or any verse beyond is as powerful as love.
