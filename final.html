        I've learned so much about coding, creativity, art and problem-solving this semester. Below is a list of all the project's I've completed:
      </p>

    <div class="in-text-heading">
      <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="media-content" id="assignment1-content">

    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>
        Assignment 1 was all about laying a foundation of organization. It's easier for coding to feel complex, chaotic and confusing especially when you are first starting. For our first assignment we explored Github repositories as a way to organize our work.

        For our second assignment I completed the Dance Party Hour of Code on code.org and also explored coding on Artist Lab. These simple tools with their warm, inviting interfaces helped me explore the concepts of logic and coding in a fun and unassuming way. I even got to create something of my own design!
      </p>

    <div class="in-text-heading">
      <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="media-content" id="assignment3-content">

    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>
        Assignment 3 invited me to explore Scratch, yet another introductory tool for creative coding. This assignment was something of a breakthrough for me. I sort of went all out by bringing in skills, applications and techniques from a number of other Media Arts classes to create my own art assets for upload into Scratch. I chose to tell the story of an astronaut's spaceship breaking down in midflight, forcing the astronaut to do a spacewalk to make the repairs before flying away again. It made the whole process that much more rewarding when I was able to animate my own art and use it to tell a story. This assignment also helped me see how artistic asset creation and coding can work hand-in-hand to create a meaningful experience.

        For the fourth assignment I explored applab and playlab. Above you can see a screenshot of the painting canvas app I designed next to the wizard/zombie/princess game I created on playlab. I enjoyed coding the controls for the applab canvas, but I would have liked to have taken more time to develop more nuanced settings. The game was way too much fun. I even added an effect where the wizard could launch magic missiles at the zombies. This game was a bit of an homage to D&D and tabletop roleplaying games. This assignment also required us to get feedback from others. I really appreciated this part of the creative process since I had several people provide positive feedback as well as suggestions for improvement. It was encouraging to know that even at this early stage of coding I was able to create something that users found interesting and engaging.

        The fifth assignment took me into a three dimensional space by using the coding application Alice. I really enjoyed designing this game where you play as a princess trying to recover a magic crystal from some wicked trolls. I actually made one of my friends jump when the trolls started chasing him, which was so rewarding. I got a little creative with the screenshot here since I wanted to sho the game and the code side-by-side. I really enjoyed learning about conditional triggers and sequences and it made me thing about how the logic of coding can recreate the principles of cause-and-effect that we see in the physical world.

      <h1>Assignment 6</h1>

    <div class="media-content" id="assignment6-content">

      <p>
        For Assignment 6 we embarked on a journey of web development and design by tackling HTML. This assignment was interesting for me as I was also taking MART 341 Intro to Web Design this semester. Many of the concepts were already familiar to me, but it was enlightening to see it all from a different perspective. Above you can see a screenshot of some of the code I wrote in Atom along with the resulting html document.

      <p>
        In Assignment 7 we explored CSS. We actually started learning CSS in this class about the same time I was beginning to use it in my Intro to Web Design class. This repetition really drove home the concepts for me and throughout the semester I've fallen in love with CSS. It is such a time-saver! I used CSS extensively to help me style this final porfolio page.

      <h1>Assignment 8</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="media-content" id="assignment8-content">
      <img class="img-content" id="assignment8-img-content" src="./images/assignment8.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>
        Assignment 8 got me into Javascript through a project on forms validation and a math game. I loved the math game and it was extremely satisfying when I finally got the results to show up after ten guesses. The forms validation was very difficult for me. It was hard to create a form that was designed to work on an imaginary script. I think I need a more comprehensive understanding of how data transmission through forms works in the real world before I can truly graps how forms work. These projects definitely scrambled my mind as I tried to solve the puzzle so the screnshot above is attempting to represent that struggle by overlaying all the code and results together. This was an important lesson to give myself plenty of time to complete the assignments and to be patient with myself.

    <div class="in-text-heading">
      <h1>Assignment 9</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="media-content" id="assignment9-content">
      <img class="img-content" id="assignment9-img-content" src="./images/assignment9.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>
        One-hundred and thirty-four lines of code were required to write my self portrait for Assignment 9. Many of those 134 lines were identical except for three numbers, the points of a triangle. There is a sort of poetry to be found in this repetition as we've discussed previously in this class. However, I have to wonder...would it be quicker just to draw it? I think where coding really shines for art is in what you might call economies of scale. Sure, 134 lines of code might seem like a lot for one pixelated, childlike portrait, but what if I wanted to make 1,000 of those portraits? This assignment hinted at the power of code for situations like that.

    <div class="in-text-heading">
      <h1>Assignment 10</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="media-content" id="assignment10-content">
      <img class="img-content" id="assignment10-img-content" src="./images/assignment10.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>
        Assignment 10 got a little crazy. My eyes were flying off of my head and my mouth jumped off of my face. Well, really this wasn't happening to me, but rather to my digital self portrait from Assignment 9. For the 10th assignment we dove into using p5.js to create dynamic motion of elements we had drawn. This was really fun, and suddenly I realized even more potential uses for all those lines of code. Using p5.js I can draw something, then make it move, change and interact with other things I've drawn. These are clearly some of the fundamental building blocks of interactive experiences.

      <h1>Assignment 11</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="media-content" id="assignment11-content">
      <img class="img-content" id="assignment11-img-content" src="./images/assignment11.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>
        With Assignment 11 we launched a new project in p5.js with the intention of creating a Spore-like game. Experimenting with animation and changes in direction was great fun! I cast a triangle in the role of hero who was pursued by rectangles as it sought its way to the Exit. Truly, this is dramatic, narrative storytelling at its best!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="in-text-heading">
      <h1>Assignment 12</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="media-content" id="assignment12-content">
      <img class="img-content" id="assignment12-img-content" src="./images/assignment12.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>
        Assignment 12 led us to refine our Spore-like game. We accomplished the same end result, but we created functions and then called them. This allowed for cleaner, more efficient coding to achieve the desired result. Will the triangle make it to the Exit? Only time will tell!

    <div class="in-text-heading">
      <h1>Assignment 13</h1>

      <p>
        This time, for our last project we unlocked the power of arrays. With each successive week in p5.js we found ways to make our coding more organized, efficient, and powerful. Arrays allowed us to specify rnages of variables which we could then reference in our code. FOr this assignment I amped up the movement and dynamics of the rectangles such that the appeared, disappeared and moved in the twinkling of an eye. Trying to avoid all those obstacles? Not a chance! Here I began to see the potential for some really beautiful, powerful and dynamic interactive art. I'm excited to see where creative coding takes me in the future!
